          right to sell it in open market. SWAY-SPIN reserves right to sue you
          legally if individual is found doing so. We grant you a lifetime
          access license, except when we must disable the course because of
          legal or policy reasons. Under our Instructor Terms, instructor gives
          right to SWAY-SPIN to offer the same commercially to the students , they
          grant SWAY-SPIN a license to offer a license to the course to students.
          This means that SWAY-SPIN have the right to sublicense the course to the
          students who enroll in the course. The license gives you the right to
          enroll in the course whether its free or paid and use the same subject
          to the terms and conditions laid down. The license gives you the right
          to access the courses but it cannot be further sold. Any violation in
          this regard(including by sharing account information with a purchaser
          or illegally downloading the course and sharing it on torrent sites)
          shall give SWAY-SPIN the right to discontinue the services availed by the
          individual. SWAY-SPIN grants you (as a student) a limited, non-exclusive,
          non-transferable license to access and view the courses and associated
          content for which you have paid all required fees, solely for your
          personal, non-commercial, educational purposes through the Services,
          in accordance with these Terms and any conditions or restrictions
          associated with a particular courses or feature of our Services. All
          other uses are expressly prohibited. You may not reproduce,
          redistribute, transmit, assign, sell, broadcast, rent, share, lend,

          authorized representative. This also applies to content you can access
          via any of our APIs. We generally give a lifetime access license to
          our students when they enroll in a course. However, we reserve the
          right to revoke any license to access and use courses at any point in
          time in the event where we decide or are obligated to disable access
          to a course due to legal or policy reasons, for example, if the course
          you enrolled in is the object of a copyright complaint, or if we
          determine its content violates our Trust &amp; Safety Guidelines. The
          lifetime access is not applicable to add-on features and services
          associated with a course. For example, translation captions of courses
          may be disabled by instructors at any time, and instructors may decide
          at any time to no longer provide teaching assistance or Q&amp;A
          services in association with a course. To be clear, the lifetime
          access is to the course content but not to the instructor. Instructors
          may not grant licenses to their courses to students directly, and any
          such direct license shall be null and void and a violation of these
          Terms.

          The prices of courses on SWAY-SPIN are determined based on the terms of
          the Instructor Terms and our Promotions Policy. In some instances, the
          price of a course offered on the SWAY-SPIN website may not be exactly the
          same as the price offered on our mobile, due to mobile platform
          providers’ pricing systems and their policies around implementing
          sales and promotions. We regularly run promotions and sales for our
          courses and certain courses are only available at discounted prices
          for a set period of time. The price applicable to a course will be the
          price at the time you complete your purchase of the course (at
          checkout). Any price offered for a particular course may also be
          different when you are logged into your account from the price
          available to users who aren’t registered or logged in, because some of
          our promotions are available only to new users. If you are a student
          located in a country where use and sales tax, goods and services tax,
          or value added tax is applicable to consumer sales, we are responsible
          for collecting and remitting that tax to the proper tax authorities.
          Depending on your location, the price you see may include such taxes,
          or tax may be added at checkout.

          over the courses that are available on the platform and, as such, do
          not guarantee in any manner the reliability, validity, accuracy, or

          keep such content from you and no liability for your access or
          enrollment in any course, to the extent permissible under applicable

          such courses you choose to assume those risks voluntarily, including
          risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death. You assume full
          responsibility for the choices you make before, during, and after your
          enrollment in a course. When you interact directly with a student or
          an instructor, you must be careful about the types of personal
          information that you share. While we restrict the types of information
          instructors may request from students, we do not control what students
          and instructors do with the information they obtain from other users
          on the platform. You should not share your email or other personal
          information about you for your safety. We do not hire or employ
          instructors nor are we responsible or liable for any interactions
          involved between instructors and students. We are not liable for
          disputes, claims, losses, injuries, or damage of any kind that might

          By enrolling on our platform you agree to enter into legally binding
          contract with us for availing our services. If you do not agree to
          these Terms, do not register, access, or otherwise use any of our
          Services. If you are an instructor accepting these Terms and using our
          Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other
          legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do
          so. In case of any conflict the English translation of our terms and
          conditions shall guide as to the true meaning of the terms and
          conditions laid down. These Terms (including any agreements and
          policies linked from these Terms) constitute the entire agreement
          between you and us (which include, if you are an instructor, the
          Instructor Terms and the Promotions Policy). If any part of these
          Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by applicable law, then
          that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable
          provision that most closely matches the intent of the original
          provision and the remainder of these Terms will continue in effect.
          Even if we are delayed in exercising our rights or fail to exercise a
          right in one case, it doesn’t mean we waive our rights under these
          Terms, and we may decide to enforce them in the future. If we decide
          to waive any of our rights in a particular instance, it doesn’t mean
          we waive our rights generally or in the future. The following sections
          shall survive the expiration or termination of these Terms: Sections 2
          (Course Enrollment and Lifetime Access), 5 (SWAY-SPIN Rights to Content
          You Post), 6 (Using SWAY-SPIN at Your Own Risk), 7 (SWAY-SPIN Rights), 8

          You may not assign or transfer these Terms (or the rights and licenses
          granted under them). For example, if you registered an account as an
          employee of a company, your account cannot be transferred to another
          employee. We may assign these Terms (or the rights and licenses
          granted under them) to another company or person without restriction.
          Nothing in these Terms confers any right, benefit, or remedy on any
          third-party person or entity. You agree that your account is
          non-transferable and that all rights to your account and other rights
          under these Terms terminate upon your death.

          From time to time, we may update these Terms to clarify our practices
          or to reflect new or different practices (such as when we add new
          features), and SWAY-SPIN reserves the right in its sole discretion to
          modify and/or make changes to these Terms at any time. If we make any
          material change, we will notify you using prominent means, such as by
          email notice sent to the email address specified in your account or by
          posting a notice through our Services. Modifications will become
          effective on the day they are posted unless stated otherwise. Your
          continued use of our Services after changes become effective shall
          mean that you accept those changes. Any revised Terms shall supersede
          all previous Terms.
